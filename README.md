# car-pi
Some scripts and utilities for a raspberry pi that acts as a vehicle alarm system.

The codebase is pretty scattered and unorganized while I prototype, it will be improved at a later time

# Implementation
Inside of a project box, I have the following items:

Raspberry Pi 3 Model B

12v battery voltage cutoff to prevent draining my battery

12v -> 3.3v 4 channel opto-isolator board for signalling

12v -> 5v buck converter for power

Wifi card with SMA connector and high gain antenna
